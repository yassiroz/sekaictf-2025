I've created the Miku Music Machine (MMM for short)! Just give it an input, and it will use coding and algorithms™ to generate a beautiful personalized tune based on your prompt. Can you compose a song that pleases Miku?

> ❖ **Note**  
> This challenge does not work on Wine.

> ❖ **Note**  
> The original version of this challenge (`miku-music-machine.exe`) relies on a specific Windows feature that was removed in most recent Windows versions. Running on these versions results in invalid flags being accepted by the binary. To avoid this issue, we've attached `mmm-v2.exe` which will work on all Windows versions. The flag is identical for both versions.
